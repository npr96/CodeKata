Attempt One
===========

What do we look at while making decisions?
------------------------------------------
### 
When thinking about pricing for a supermarket, how do we judge between different options?
There will be multiple parties interacting with our system:
*The Customer
*The Supermarket
*External Auditors
We should think about these parties and how they interact with our system.
###
How do we resolve conflicts between the interests of these parties?
Who takes priority? We are the ones who are making the system, but we need to take in more than our own convienience into account. See our givins below. External auditors wield power to wreck us if they do not recieve information from us, and the convienience of customers should be considered, as we want them to purchase from us. For this project, the order of priority is external auditors > customers > the supermarket.
### 
What are our givins?
What reality does this supermarket exist in? Is it our own reality or should we create our own? For this attempt I think I will think of our supermarket in the context of my local environment. 
###
What constitutes a Supermarket?
For this project a supermarket is a store that sells a variety of goods including but not limited to groceries and food, electronics, small appliances, car care procucts, limited home furnishings, and shoes.
###
Do we have power over price?
For this project we do not. 

Fractional Currency
-------------------
###
Should it exist?
If fractional currency does not exist then  
*denominations of money must be of sufficiently low worth to allow transactions to take place.
*Restrictions must either be placed on the amount of goods purchasable at one time with at least a minimum value established, or restrictions must be placed on the goods sold.
If fractional currency does exist then
*A rounding system must be established.
When thinking about pricing in a Supermarket, the system of fractional currency is already worked out by the monetary system. We don't have to use it, but if we want to it is there. Furthermore, not using it would likely cause friction with customers if we didn't.
For this attempt, we will use fractionall currency based on the US monetary system.  

Rounding
--------
###
Who cares about rounding?
The Supermarket cares because of the sheer volume of transactions. They stand to make or lose a ton of money depending on this decision.
The customer cares as well, but to a lesser extent as they also have a volume of transactions
If our rounding is extreme then external auditors may care.
###
Possible rounding possibilities
*no rounding
probably not possible. The supermarket will buy in bulk and this causes issues as we subdivide what is bought into smaller portions assuming that we do not fix this issue with a pricing scheme. Also an issue with bulk and produce purchases as we will probably have to rownd the weight or the price to avoid decimals that we cannot support with our fractional system.
*backend rownding
We round on the backend only. Rownding takes place when purchasing goods and subdividing them only. Allows subdivision of goods, but not bulk or produce purchases. 
*backend and frontend rounding
allows subdivision, bulk and produce purchases
For this project we will allow backend and frontend rounding. 
###
System of rounding
Do we round up or down and at what level?
On the backend we will round up. On the frontend we will round down. 
On all levels we should round to the nearest cent. 

How Much Do We Charge For a Good?
---------------------------------
depending on our local environment, and the circumstances we are located in we may not even have the power to set prices. We do not have power to set prices so we will price at market price. The issue is going to be discovering that price, and also how often we change prices.
###
Price change frequency
*constant price change
the price can change at any moment. Issues include difficulty in updating prices. Information to the consumer would either have to be limited, leading them to be less likely to purchase, or we would need a dynamic way to portray prices to consumers. This will also likely lead to an issue with the culture of our store, as it is unknown if the price will be the same moment to moment.
*periodic price change
pricing changes periodically. It would be easiest to change prices overnight as there is less trafic. This is not an issue if the store is open at all times as we can staff more people on night shift to deal with this. If we are not open at all times, then it would be wise to hire a crew to come in before opening hours each day.
we will change prices periodically.
